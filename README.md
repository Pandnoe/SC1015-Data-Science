# Introduction
For SC1015 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligience mini-project, we will be using IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset 
from Kaggle.

PS. When accessing miniProj.ipynb from github, sometimes it will not be able to display HVPlot even though the code is correct. Should the HVPlot cannot be seen, please refer to the HVPlot and Data Description word.docx, for visualisation. Thank you!

# Group Members (A134 - Team 7):
- Ying Hao 
- Louis Ng

# Pratical Motivation
- Individual Point of View. We are soon to be working adults therefore, we would like to know what factors are important when choosing a job that will ensure that I have a long career in that company
- Company Point of View. Find out how many employees are going to quit in advance so that company is able to recruit more people

# Sample Collection
- Our dataset was taken from Kaggle IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance.

# Machine Learning Models
- Random Forest Tree Classifier
- Logistic Regression

# Conclusion
- Random Forest Classification is a better model in determining attrition as compared to Logistic Regression. (Better accuracy and Accounts for many different factors)
- Random Forest is able to predict who is going to quit the company depending on the elements(factors)
- Hence, the companies will be able to start proactively recuit people for those roles

# Learning Outcomes
- New data visualisation tool, HvPlot that enable us to recognise patterns in our data easily
- Deskewing our dataset using SMOTE 
- New machine learning model - Logistic Regression
